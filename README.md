# Plant_Disease_Prediction_CNN_DeepLearning

Project Overview

Plant diseases can significantly impact agricultural productivity. This project leverages deep learning and computer vision to identify various plant diseases from leaf images. The model is trained to classify healthy and diseased plants to support early diagnosis and treatment.

Features
- Image preprocessing.
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using Keras/TensorFlow.
- Model training, evaluation, and performance visualization.
- Prediction on test images with output visualizations.

Dataset

The model was trained on a dataset of labeled plant leaf images. You can use publicly available datasets such as:
- [PlantVillage Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmarex/plantdisease)
